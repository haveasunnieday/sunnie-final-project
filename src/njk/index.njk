        Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mercury">Freddie Mercury</a> (lead vocals and piano), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_May">Brian May</a> (lead guitar and vocals), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Taylor_(Queen_drummer)">Roger Taylor</a> (drums and vocals), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deacon">John Deacon</a> (bass guitar). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.
